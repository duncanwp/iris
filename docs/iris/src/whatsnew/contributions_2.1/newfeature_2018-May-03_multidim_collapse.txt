* The partial collapse of multi-dimensional auxiliary coordinates is now
  supported. Collapsed bounds span the range of the collapsed dimension(s).
  *Note* the collapsed points now represent the mean over the collapsed
  dimensions(s) rather than the mid-point as was previously used (for full
  collapse).
